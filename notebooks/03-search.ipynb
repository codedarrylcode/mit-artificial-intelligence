It does so by finding the minimum or maximum (depending on the criteria) possibility of going down a certain path and stops when it's proven that the evaluated path is worse than a previously examined path. It returns the same answer as Minimax but with much lesser computations, $S \\approx 2b^{\\frac{d}{2}}$\n",

    "When $b, d$ gets too big, it may be computationally costly to evaluate at $b^d$. A heuristic way to reduce computational cost is to reduce $d$ and one could consider evaluating at $b^{d-1}$ and reduce depth levels till computational cost is reasonable. Instead of defining this depth level, one can also consider defining the computational cost (e.g. time) and evaluate level by level, starting from $b^0, \\dots, b^d$ and stops when cost has been reached. This ensures that the best possible answer is returned for a given constrained computational cost. This is a combination of breadth-first and depth-first search and is referred to as an **iterative deepening** search.\n",
